GLM v2.0.0 Release Notes

The following major changes have been made that require the user to change
their input files.

1) GLM now reads a glm2.nml file with the following updates from glm.nml:
    a) The Areas in the hypsographic curve (A under &morphometry in the
       glm2.nml file) are now in m2 not 1000m2 so you will need to multiply
       your areas by 1000.
    b) The coefficient of wind drag, coef_wind_drag has been renamed cd.
    c) The coefficient of inflow entrainment, coef_inf_entrain has been
       moved to the &inflow section of glm2.nml.
    d) The option to output lake number, out_lkn has been removed as it is
       included as default output.

2) The units for inflow input files have been changed from ML/day to m3/s, all
   inflow files will need to be adjusted accordingly. 
3) The units for outflow input files have been changed from ML/day to m3/s, all
   outflow files will need to be adjusted accordingly.
