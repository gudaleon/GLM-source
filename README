# Notes 2013-11-26
#
# Compiling, at this stage, requires Intel Fortran as well as
# the C compilers.  Some effort has been put into making it
# compile with gfortran, however there is a problem in the
# C/Fortran interoperability, specifically in structured arrays.
# There sre some notes in glm_fabm.F90
#
# Some effort was made toward a Macintosh OS-X version, however
# it seems there may be a bug in the OS-X version of Intel's 
# fortran compiler version 13.0.0(088) which means it hangs
# while trying to load the fabm module ( USE fabm )
